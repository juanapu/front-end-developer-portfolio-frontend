After graduation, i entered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbnu.edu/eng/">Chonbuk National University</a> (2012 - 2015) in South Korea in recognition of my GPA and advanced fluency in Korean. My Master's program focused on research was in routing algorithms.

	                <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase">How did i become a front-end developer </h5>
	                <p>
	                    Two months before graduation, i received an offer from a large software company in Shanghai, China as an International Support Specialist and one offer from a start-up software company in Beijing, China as Operation Specialist. I studied both companies' business and decided to go Beijing. 
	                    <br />
	                    During my first year on the operation team, I utilized skills such as Photoshop and Iluustrator, which i self-studied at Yanbian University, to build an email campaign and marketing landing page. At that time, i was introduced to HTML, CSS, and Javascript while gaining competence in buisiness organization and team management. I enjoyed the feeling of transforming a design into a product. Thus, i dove into front-end development more. 
	                    <br />
	                    In 2016, i began working for a Korean software company as a web designer.

	               <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase">what i've done</h5>
	                <p>
	                  I contributed in two projects for a company's website development. One was a homepage built by using PHP + cakePHP + jQuery, which allowed users to open online stores, join online communities, setup personal pages, share blogs and tracking delivery . Another one was a payment website to help users that make financial transactions safe and secure.

	                <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase">My self-learning plan </h5>
	                <p>
	                  Right now, i am learning node.js, express, mongoDB to gain more back-end knowledge. Later, i will dive into html5 and css3 more to build up my ability to create games. Offline, i will continue studying painting and design to improve my vision design ability.
